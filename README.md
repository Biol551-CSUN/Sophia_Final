**Introduction**

The [Deforestation](https://ourworldindata.org/forests-and-deforestation) dataset was used to further look into why our forests are being reduced.

**We will examine:**
-  **Where are we losing forests?**
-  **What is impacting the loss of forests?**

**Visuals included:**
-  **Map - forest area throughout the world**
-  **Pie chart - factors that cause forest loss in Brazil for 2001 & 2013**
-  **Line chart - Usage of soybean & production of vegetable oil**
